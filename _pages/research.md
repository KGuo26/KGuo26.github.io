My research mainly focus on high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods and high performance computing. For high order DG methods, I am particularly interested in wave simulation through arbitrarily heterogeneous media and moving domains. 


## Efficient high order methods for wave propagation through heterogeneous media

## Numerical methods for moving meshes in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework
