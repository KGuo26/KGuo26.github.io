I am a fifth year PhD student from the [Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://caamweb.rice.edu) at Rice University under the advisement of [Prof. Jesse Chan](https://jlchan.github.io). My research focuses on high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for time-dependent wave equations. I am particularly interested in developing provably stable and high order accurate DG methods for wave propagation through arbitrarily heterogeneous media and moving domains. I also design efficient and highly parallelizable algorithms to implement explicit time-stepping DG schemes on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

## Recent news:

* September 2020: Kaihang Guo has successfully passed his PhD proposal.
* June 2020: our paper ["A weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin method for wave propagation in coupled elastic-acoustic media"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199912030406X) with Prof. Jesse Chan and Prof. Sebastian Acosta was accepted to JCP and is now online.
* November 2019: Kaihang Guo presented work on wave propagation in acoustic-elastic media at the SIAM LA-TX sectional meeting in Dallas, TX.
* September 2019: our paper ["Bernstein-Bezier weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin methods for wave propagation in heterogeneous media"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199911930676X) with Prof. Jesse Chan was accepted to JCP and is now online.
* July 2019: Kaihang Guo gave a talk at USNCCM 2019 in Austin, TX.
* June 2019: Kaihang Guo presented work on Bernstein-Bezier weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin methods at the North American High Order Methods Conference (NAHOMCon) in San Diego, CA.
* March 2019: Kaihang Guo gave a talk at the Finite Element Rodeo in Austin, TX.
* May 2019: our preprint "A weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin method for wave propagation in coupled elastic-acoustic media" is available as an [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09145), and introduces a new provably stable high order DG methods for wave propagation in coupled acoustic-elastic media. As with previous weight-adjusted DG papers, the method is time-explicit, high order accurate, and applicable to sub-cell micro heterogeneities, anisotropic media, and curved meshes.
* August 2018: Kaihang Guo successfully defended his MA thesis on low-complexity GPU-accelerated DG methods for wave propagation in media with sub-cell heterogeneities. This work is available online in an [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08645).
* Jan 2018: Kaihang Guo receives the [K2i fellowship](http://news.rice.edu/2018/01/02/ken-kennedy-institute-awards-67500-to-9-graduate-students/?fbclid=IwAR2K8HVRlmAc03s6-t97tENqLlfqou0p3iUYEuAn7dHAbYlL_jClF-z4Bws) from the Ken Kennedy Institute.
