My research focuses on computational mechanics and the efficient numerical solution of time-dependent partial differential equations. 

## Recent news:

* September 2020: Kaihang Guo has successfully passed his PhD proposal.
* June 2020: our paper ["A weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin method for wave propagation in coupled elastic-acoustic media"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199912030406X) with Prof. Jesse Chan and Prof. Sebastian Acosta was accepted to JCP and is now online.
* November 2019: Kaihang Guo presented work on wave propagation in acoustic-elastic media at the SIAM LA-TX sectional meeting in Dallas, TX.
* July 2019: Kaihang Guo gave a talk at USNCCM 2019 in Austin, TX.
* May 2019: our preprint "A weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin method for wave propagation in coupled elastic-acoustic media" is available as an [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09145), and introduces a new provably stable high order DG methods for wave propagation in coupled acoustic-elastic media. As with previous weight-adjusted DG papers, the method is time-explicit, high order accurate, and applicable to sub-cell micro heterogeneities, anisotropic media, and curved meshes.
* August 2018: Kaihang Guo successfully defended his MA thesis on low-complexity GPU-accelerated DG methods for wave propagation in media with sub-cell heterogeneities. This work is available online in an [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08645).
* Jan 2018: Kaihang Guo receives the [K2i fellowship](https://caamweb.rice.edu/news/k2i-fellowships-2017) from the Ken Kennedy Institute.
